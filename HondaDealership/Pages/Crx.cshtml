            This CRX was sourced from the United States.
            It had come from a family that had a number of cars.
            This car was the mans GrandMothers. After the Grandmother
            had passed away the car was covered up
            and stored in the back yard for 25 years. I
            reassured the owner that it would be going to
            another great home.
        </td>
        <td>
            The car has been spray painted. Cleaned of rust and
            sealed up. It has had some minor Interior repairs and a full
            service. It has been a truly preserved classic.
